        <summary>
            <p>A middle-aged man set out alone from Frankton marina, Queenstown for an evening paddle to the Shotover/Kawarau confluence. When passing under the Kawarau Falls bridge (through one of last two of the channels towards the campground), victim apparently became trapped in a reversal (hole) formed by the weir between the bridge pylons. His body was discovered 250m below the bridge shortly after, with the PFD covering his face. CPR was administered without success. His boat, paddle and spraydeck were subsequently recovered at various points downstream.</p>
        </summary>

        <discussion>
            <p>The victim was unable to eskimo roll, but that may not have been a contributing factor.<br/>
                The victim was adequately equipped for the trip, but his PFD may not have been well fitted/designed.<br/>
                He was unfamiliar with the section of river.<br/>
                A large sign (intended for jetboats) indicating "Down Traffic This Way" is positioned above channel 2 (counting from the southern end of the bridge).<br/>
                Channel 2 contains a powerful reversal at some (possibly all) flows.</p>

            <p>The NZRCA recommends that kayakers don't paddle alone.<br/>
                Seek local knowledge of conditions and hazards before embarking on an unfamiliar section (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.1">Recommendation 1.1</a>).<br/>
                Ensure PFDs are secure and well-fitting (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.5">Recommendation 1.5</a>).<br/>
                Have sufficient knowledge to re
                cognise hazards (esp. those formed by artificial structures) (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.27">Recommendation 1.27</a>).<br/>
                At certain lake levels, weirs in specific channels below the Kawarau Falls bridge can form lethal hydraulics.<br/>
                New warning signage has been placed on the bridge, directing kayakers to a safe channel.<br/>
                With reference to the ODT headlines below, the hydraulic involved was a 'reversal' not a 'whirlpool'.</p>

            <p>A local kayaker, paddling alone, passed under the southern end of the Kawarau Falls bridge and became caught in the powerful recirculation formed by the concrete sill.

            <!-- specifiy location -->
            <p>A three-person team reached a rapid approximately 2.5 hours below Canton Bridge. One paddler  gave verbal instructions for running a drop to his two companions from a flat-topped rock instream. Both companions ran drop, and one swam. As the two companions recovered from the swim, they became concerned about the victim's absence.</p>

            <p>The two paddlers could see that the third paddler had left the boulder and blew their whistles to attract his attention. After approximately five minutes, one paddler paddled and then walked upstream, where he discovered the victim vertically pinned in a narrow slot three metres to river right from the boulder from which the first paddler had scouted the rapid. The victim was conscious and moving and could grab breaths by raising his head above the water.</p>

            <p>Both companions grabbed their safety gear. A throwbag was thrown to the victim who appeared to be showing signs of cyanosis (http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/cyanosis.html). They managed to get a rope to the victim but pulling on the rope was ineffective. The spray-deck was on. One paddler managed to manoevre so that he could stand across the slot and pull on the victim's PFD but to no avail. The victim was now unconscious. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was attempted and a rope was clipped to a shoulder strap of the victim's PFD. Both rescuer's pulled on the rope but the PFD eventually rode up above the victim's head.</p>

            <p>The rope was transferred from the PFD to the rear grab-loop on the victim's kayak, but pulling from various angles was ineffective. Next a sling was placed around the victim's chest and tension applied via the rope but this was not effective either. Additional mouth-to-mouth was performed.</p>

            <p>In desperation, one paddler jumped on the victim's kayak while the second held the rope attached to the chest-sling. Both the kayak and victim disappeared from view. The rescuer on the kayak passed through the slot and discovered a tree across the current as he made his way out via an undercut on river right. The victim slipped from the chest sling. One rescuer held the other's feet as the latter tried to locate the victim under the boulder. Meanwhile the victim's empty kayak washed out from under a boulder on river left.</p>

            <p>After the victim had not been sighted for approximately 5-10 minutes, the other paddlers searched where possible, but eventually abandoned the search. They stashed their gear and bush-bashed downriver, overnighting near a swingbridge. At dawn they reached the road where they flagged down a car and alerted authorities. The body was recovered by SAR personnel that morning via helicopter, approximately 150m from the accident site.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>The team was fit, experienced and well-equipped, and were paddling appropriate kayaks.</p>

            <p>It is not known when the dent in the victim's kayak occurred, but if it occurred in the slot it may have prevented his exit.</p>

            <p>It is not clear how the victim came to be in the slot. Once in the slot, it appears that the victim awaited assistance rather than risk making the situation worse by wet-exiting. According to the MSA report, hypothermia does not appear to have been a factor.</p>

            <p>The MSA report says <q>Although at the time it would have seemed quite reasonable for Kayaker 1 [the victim] to seal-launch back into the river when Kayaker 2 and Kayaker 3 appeared in need of assistance, this decision to do so was ultimately a contributing factor to his demise. He could have chosen to walk his boat 5-10 metres down stream over the rocks and seal launch into the pool on river right.</q></p>

        <summary>
            <p>An experienced group of eight international kayakers helicoptered into the Upper Hokitika (via Mungo River) for the second descent (over two days). Halfway through the first day, all paddlers except one got out to inspect a set of rapids from the bank, around 2-3km upstream of Frisco canyon. The paddler on the water successfully ran the rapid after receiving verbal instructions. A second paddler ran the rapid with no problems. The third paddler received instructions from the first paddler, but on his run the third paddler subbed-out in a chute and pinned, submerged, against a rock. It appears that he released his paddle and exited the kayak, but quickly kayak and paddler were out of sight.</p>

            <p>The other paddlers were swiftly in position to effect a rescue (&lt; 1 minute). Several jumped into the eddy above but could not assist. Attempts to snag the victim or boat were unsuccessful, so a z-drag or other rope-based extraction could not be utilised. After an hour of fruitless rescue attempts, the group continued the run to Serpentine Hut, where they could radio for assistance.</p>

            <p>The victim's body was eventually recovered on January 10, on the third effort at extrication. Several grappling hooks were straightened when pulled due to the water pressure. A 3:1 pulley-system with four people pulling was eventually used to extract the body. The water pressure was too great to recover the kayak.</p>

            <!--   He then went over a 4 ft drop with a strong pillow and fold created
         by a rock just downstream. He subbed out in the seam similar to Arnd and
         Gustav but pinned against the rock just underwater. His paddle was
         immediately released and it looked as though he made a quick attempt at
         exiting his boat. Within seconds Robin and his boat where underwater and out
         of site. In less than a minute, 6 of us where able to get within 6 feet of
         where we last saw Robin but were unable to either see or help him. Arnd,
         Dave, and Tomas all made a very bold jump into a tiny eddy above the sieve.
         Arnd was then lowered down in front of the rock by his feet for several
         attempts at reaching Robin underwater. Unfortunately the current was to
         strong and Robin was out of reach. We later tried snagging him and his boat
         with ropes and a Z-drag but nothing seemed to work. After over an hour of
         rescue effort we decided to continue through the rest of the canyon to the
         hut where we were to spend the night.
         From there we were able to radio the helicopter pilot and let him know what
         had happened. The next day a team of search and rescue flew to assist in
         extraction. At the present time all recovery attempts have been
         unsuccessful..  -->

            <!-- the MSA report is superficial, and only based on the depositions esp. from Marc Lyle -->

            <p>The victim was experienced, well-equipped and in a strong party.</p>

            <p>If the volume and design of the kayak were not contributing factors, then the victim was desperately unlucky:
                <ul>
                    <li>since his line was close to that of the two succesful previous paddlers.</li>
                    <li>to become entrapped in a rock-sieve that was not an obvious hazard.</li>
                    <li>to be out of reach of rescue attempts.</li>
                </ul></p>

            <p>It appears that his companions made a series of heroic rescue attempts that were unsuccesful. It is unclear from the available reports whether a strong-swimmer rescue (with throw-bag tether) was attempted. It is unclear whether a device to hold a carabiner open on the end of a paddle blade could have been used successfully.</p>

            <p>The NZRCA rejects the assertion by MSA that the <q>the knowledge of the kayakers rescue techniques was negligible</q> (MSA, 1999). On the evidence available, it is not possible to draw that conclusion. Given the years of experience of the group, such a conclusion would be surprising.</p>

        <summary>
            <p>Four kayakers from a group of 14 put-on in a large pool approx. 200m upstream of the helicopter landing site. Two paddlers successfully ran the first drop (a small hole), but the third came through off-balance and capsized in aerated water on the eddyline. The paddler rolled up but consequently descended the second drop backwards. The paddler again capsized, washed past a rock and wet-exited.</p>

            <p>The fourth paddler reached the swimmer but could not push the kayak clear of the current before the third drop (a 1m watefall) approx. 25m above the helicopter landing site. The victim went over the drop in 'whitewater swimming position' and became caught against the right-hand wall.</p>

            <p>A kayak nose was offered but the victim was unable to maintain his grip and slipped below the surface and out of sight. After 5-10 minutes, his PFD flushed-out. After waiting to the point where it was clear the victim had not survived, the group paddled 800m to the entrance of Kakariki Canyon and discovered the body of the paddler in a large eddy on river left. As a result of efforts to move the body downstream, it sank and only became visible at the end of the canyon.</p>

            <p>A strong-swimmer rescue was effected and once the victim was ashore several CPR attempts were made but were ineffective (the victim had been underwater for around 45 minutes). Several kayakers paddled out to raise the alarm and the body was extricated by helicopter later that afternoon.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>Overall the group were experienced, safety-conscious and well-equipped, though the victim was probably at his limit in the conditions, particularly since he was in a play-boat rather than a creek-boat. A creek-boat may have provided a greater margin of safety (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.24">Recommendation 1.24</a>).</p>

            <p>The MSA report raised questions regarding lines of responsibility and leadership in the context of a club trip.</p>

            <p>The MSA report recommends that paddlers jettison equipment if it could enable retrieval of a swimmer before going over a drop (ie. the priority for rescue is the person).</p>

            <p>It is not clear whether a strong-swimmer rescue or tagline rescue was attempted after the victim disappeared from view in the pour-over.</p>

            <p>After approximately 2.25hrs on the river, a party of five kayakers reached a class III-IV rapid. One kayaker got out to inspect the rapid, got back in his kayak, successfully ran the rapid and gave the 'OK' signal. The next paddler followed the same line but was slightly left of the previous paddler's line at the final drop. He appeared to be intending to boof the ledge, but had lost all his momentum landing on the ledge.</p>

            <p>The paddler smiled, indicating he had 'blown his line', and tried to pull himself over the ledge with his left arm. He could not do so as the stern of his kayak was slowly turning with the current towards some large boulders on the left. His kayak slowly rose up, entering a sieve, stern-first. The paddler endeavoured to paddle out. In a matter of seconds the kayak and paddler disappeared beneath the surface.</p>

            <p>His companions were on the scene quickly (within 30 seconds) and found the kayak cockpit empty. His paddle emerged and they searched both downstream and reaching into the sieve. With a line attached to the kayak, two or three of the rescuers easily pulled the kayak out. A throwbag was thrown into the siphon and emerged on the other side. After 30 minutes of unsucessful searching, the group walked out to a 4WD track that led to a rural road. A passing car took them to a nearby farmhouse from where they alerted authorities. The body was recovered after three days of intensive effort by the Queenstown Swiftwater Rescue Unit and police.</p>

            <p>The victim was experienced and well-equipped, with a strong team.</p>

            <p>A creek boat with higher tail volume may have been less vulnerable to the water forces at the entrance to the sieve (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.24">Recommendation 1.24</a>).</p>

            <!-- inherent danger -->
            <p>A small misjudgement of line had fatal consequences.</p>

            <p>The group relied on the guidebook description of the river. Nobody on the trip had been on the Nevis before (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.1">Recommendation 1.1</a>).</p>

            <p>A parent aide and three students fail to avoid a partially exposed rock in the centre of the Upper Clarence River. The canoe hits the rock broadside. The paddlers rail downstream and the canoe fills with water from the downstream side. The canoe sinks and wraps across the rock. Two students are trapped between the rock and canoe, and drown. A hydraulic digger eventually pulls the canoe free. The canoe was not fitted with any added bouyancy.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>The investigation into this accident raised some thought that the students had not had enough time to practice controlling their canoe. Before the accident the canoe was largely out of control, resulting in being swept broadside onto the rock (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation3.10">Recommendation 3.10</a>).</p>

            <p>There were three adults and seven students, but since only one adult had rescue experience, the instructor-to-student ratio was insufficient (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation3.4">Recommendation 3.4</a>).</p>

            <p>The students acted correctly when they hit the rock and railed downstream, but the canoe then filled with water from the downstream side, sunk and wrapped around the rock. The lack of bouyancy in the canoe may have contributed to the accident.</p>
            <p>The canoe was firmly wrapped around the rock. Canoes present significant surface-area to oncoming water, so require a z-drag at minimum, or mechanical assistance to move.</p>

            <p>During the afternoon descent, near the end of the trip, the group becomes separated. When everyone assembles at the take-out, it is realised that one beginner paddler is missing.

            <p>It is unclear how the accident occurred because there were no witnesses.</p>
            <p>It is vital that at all times the whereabouts of every paddler is known. Clubs and commercial groups can operate a buddy system (where paddlers look out for each other in pairs), and to have an experienced 'tail-end charlie' who is the last person off the river.</p>

            <p>The first of three groups of outdoor leadership students run Rodeo rapid on the Earthquake section. A student paddles over a rock with water welling over it (left of the centre of the rapid, approx. 25m from the left bank) and is immediately pinned on a Y-shaped log behind the rock. One limb of the log is across the spray-deck and abdomen of the paddler, forcing him against the rear of the cockpit.</p>

            <p>Other members of the group, and the other two groups, arrive soon after and make repeated attempts to free the paddler from the strainer. These were unsuccessful and the victim slid under the water while still pinned against the tree. He was finally freed from the tree and washed downstream.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>It is thought the victim was unaware of the existence of the strainer hazard in Rodeo, which was not visible from upstream. The instructors and some of the students were aware of the particular strainer. Normally it is the instructor's responsibility to manage risk for the group (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation3.10">Recommendation 3.10</a>) but students need to accept more of this responsibility as they advance.</p>
            <p>The victim was capable of navigating to avoid the rock (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.21">Recommendation 1.21</a>).</p>
            <p>The hazard was not visible at higher flows. In this case, a lower flow enhanced the objective danger.</p>
            <p>The incident site appears to have been too far from the banks of the river (and feasible anchor points) for effective z-drag rescue.</p>
            <p>It is dangerous to paddle over an obstacle 'blind' (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.19">Recommendation 1.19</a>).</p>

            <p>With reference to the MSA report, it is unlikely that satellite telephone would have contributed to a successful rescue.</p>
            <!-- conclusion of MSA is that instructor was at fault. NZRCA is not comfortable with this conclusion, given the relatively straight forward nature of the rapid, and the level of competence of the students, which was beyond that of beginners.
            Furthermore, the NZRCA doesn't believe it is feasible to identify 'all significant and potentially significant hazards in rivers' for the purposes of minimisation, isolation or elimination. We question the feasibility of this, and suggest it smacks of a 'sanitisation' of the environment to eliminate risk. Instead,

            It's highly debatable that the instructor should have lead the students down the rapid. Given the mild nature of the rapid and the skill level of the students/at that point in the programme, they should be able to navigate their own way down.

            Compare to Clarence recommendations (ie. severely censure Brett Whiteley, but no mention of Clarence trip leader who had no qualifications whatsoever, or the company involved whose equipment (canoe) not up to scratch and who implemented an insufficent instructor:student ratio

            And recommending SKOANZ get copies and not NZRCA? What's up with that?

            Have we heard anything about what NZOIA have done? What feedback do they have on the MSA report? any outcomes that they can share with us?-->

            <p>Two clients were given 1.5 hours flatwater instruction on Lake Moana covering wet exits, support strokes, sweep strokes, equipment and the whitewater swimming position. A third client was collected prior to lunch.</p>

            <p>The party of three clients, two guides and a friend (who had instruction experience, but was not instructing that day) put onto the Taramakau River in hired boats below the Stanley Gooseman Bridge. About 1.5 hours of additional moving-water instruction was provided.</p>

            <p>The party set out down the river, with one guide walking along the river bank. The party would assess each section of river in approx. 100m chunks, pointing out any hazards and the correct line, then running in close succession behind the lead guide, with the friend paddling last. A support vehicle followed on SH73.</p>

            <p>After a hot-drink break, the group agreed to continue to the Taipo River confluence, and the guide on the bank took over from the friend in the kayak. On the way to Rocky Point all members of the kayaking party <q>took a few dumps and fell out</q>. The party stopped on the true right before a known hazard (a log on the true right). The clients were advised of the hazard and told to paddle on the left.</p>

            <p>The lead guide and two clients successfully passed the hazard on the left. The third client began paddling left, then relaxed. Despite called instructions, she did not paddle further left and collided head on with the log. The kayak turned sideways with the nose of the kayak between the log and the bank. The kayak was pinned with the log crossing in front of the cockpit, and gradually submerged.</p>

            <p>The guides tried several attempts at swimming to the kayak and reaching an endloop. One guide slid down the log into the water and tried to pull the kayak off using an endloop. The other guide tied tape to a tree beside the log, climbed down the log and attempted to kick the kayak free. After around 8 minutes, the kayak was wrestled free. CPR was performed on the victim for 5-10 minutes, then abandoned.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>The guides on this trip had no formal kayaking qualifications and had very limited kayaking experience.</p>

            <!-- Mick Hopkinson's comment: -->
            <p>It is highly unusual for guides to swim from their kayaks at all during a kayaking excursion.</p>

            <p>Following the Coroner's inquest, the company involved agreed to better present risks to clients, to portage where possible past strainers and undercuts, to suggest the option of jetboat backup to clients, and to hire NZOIA-qualified guides.</p>

            <p>Neither the MSA Report or Coroner's report mention the type of kayak involved, or the flow.</p>

        <summary>
            <p>An afternoon commercial trip consisting of two funyaks, one raft and one safety kayaker on the Waiau in Canterbury. A 13-year old and 12-year old were in a funyak and they hit a bluff. One person dropped their paddle and they drifted into a strainer (trees on island) and flipped. One person was trapped underwater. The other drifted past the strainer and was picked up by another funyak paddler.</p>

            <p>Both guides attempted to extract the victim. A passing jetboat was flagged down, but swamped when it floated onto the trees. A second jetboat arrived with a chainsaw and the victim was freed after approx. 15 minutes of going under. CPR was administered on the bank, and the victim was airlifted to Christchurch hospital but never recovered.</p>

            <p>The flow at the time of the accident was 197cu (at Marble Point, approx. 8km below Ferry Bridge), as the river declined from a Spring flood peak of 349cu that occurred at 3am that morning. The mean flow for the year is 98cu and a mean for October is 151cu. (Data obtained from <a href="http://www.ecan.govt.nz" title="Environment Canterbury">ECAN</a>.)</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>It's not possible on the documented evidence to say flow was a factor, but it may have contributed to the original capsize, the entrapment and the challenges of rescue (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.25">Recommendation 1.25</a>).</p>

            <p>Any group putting onto a river should have sufficient rescue skills and equipment to deal with emergency situations; in this case it is not clear whether a river-saw, strong-swimmer rescue or other techniques might have been effective (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.9">Recommendation 1.9</a>).</p>

            <p>An inflatable kayak paddled by novices is appropriate in only the most benign conditions (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.24">Recommendation 1.24</a>).</p>

            <p>There are significant deficiencies in the MSA investigation. The MSA report:
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides no flow data.</li>
                    <li>Doesn't mention what, if any, rescue gear the group carried. Did the commercial group have any capacity for rescue for an entrapment scenario? If not, why not?</li>
                    <li>Doesn't mention any experience or qualifications of those involved.</li>
                    <li>States that 5 minutes elapsed between hitting the bluff and hitting the tree. Either the lost paddle should have been remedied during that time or the times stated are inaccurate.</li>
                    <li>Makes no mention of the danger represented by the capsize of the jetboat. In any rescue situation it's important that no further harm is done.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The MSA report's recommendation, &quot;The guide giving the briefing should ensure that the serious consequences of losing a paddle are drawn the participant's attention [<em>sic</em>]&quot; is unhelpful to the wider paddling community. Of more interest is whether the high flow was a contributing factor, whether an inflatable kayak was a suitable choice of craft for the conditions, was the group adequately equipped and skilled for the trip, what rescue techniques were applied and why were they ultimately unsuccessful?</p>

            <p>A paddler went upside down above the large rock in 'Jawbreaker rapid' and bumped the rock with either paddle or arm. The victim's roll attempt failed, they realised their shoulder was abnormal, and swam. The victim was in pain and unable to paddle. A doctor in the group checked and confirmed a dislocated shoulder. A commercial raft came by, and the opportunity was taken for the injured paddler to be taken as a passenger. The raft company radioed to base and arranged for the prison to pick the victim up at the first bridge and transfer them to hospital. The remainder of the group towed the vicitm's kayak to the take-out.</p>

            <p>It is unclear what the exact cause of the dislocation was. Good roll technique can help minimise the risk of shoulder dislocation (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.28">Recommendation 1.28</a>).</p>

        <summary>
            <p>A group of nine club kayakers put onto the Mohaka at Willow Flat. Approximately 1.2km downstream on the outside of a right-hand corner were two large rocks. The rock in the centre of the current was submerged, and the rock on the left was visible 10-20cm above the water. The submerged rock was not visible until the canoeist was past it. Two paddlers successfully negotiated the rapid.</p>

            <p>It appears that one paddler attempted to avoid the visible rock, and was swept sideways and became wedged, submerged, in a slot between the two rocks. The victim was leaning downstream, and removed his spraydeck but was trapped underwater. Attempts were made to swim a rope to the trapped kayak (strong-swimmer rescue), but were defeated by the current. At one point, one paddler managed to reach down and touch the victim, but were enable to extract him. A rope was eventually tied to the victim or the boat but snapped when force was applied.</p>

            <p>An attempt was made to extract the body by helicopter the following day, but a 1000kg breaking-strain rope broke, indicating the forces involved. The body was successfully recovered two days after the accident by kayakers working with police, after a section of the bow was torn off to release the water pressure. The victim had been paddling for nine months and could roll.</p>

        <discussion>
            <p>The victim may have had insufficient experience to avoid the obstacle (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.21">Recommendation 1.21</a>).</p>

            <p>The hazard was not visible from upstream, so the victim appears to have been unlucky; whitewater kayaking has inherent risks.</p>

            <p>A party of three paddlers drove to the take-out below the Gorge and walked in for about three hours, putting on the river around 18:00. The group successfully negotiated several rapids and portaged one. After inspecting a particularly long rapid from the bank, two paddlers entered the rapid and made it to an eddy on river right. They noticed that the third paddler had entered the rapid but was in difficulty upstream of a boulder upriver from them, and was trying to brace or roll. As the two paddlers grabbed their throwbags, the third paddler floated past (without her kayak) and was lost from view behind a rock downstream.</p>

            <p>The two paddlers scouted for the victim moving downstream along the bank until they could proceed no further. One returned to his kayak and ran the remainder of the rapid. The other crossed the river and began down the track for help but was stymied by darkness. The first kayaker pulled off the river and managed to reach the vehicles (at times, on his hands and knees) and raise the alarm (around 21:00).</p>

            <p>Local SAR found the second kayaker that night, but did not find the third kayaker. The victim was located around 9:20 the next day, by members of the Tasman Whitewater Response Unit scouting by helicopter. The body was recovered without difficulty from just below the surface, in a slot/sieve immediately downstream of the eddy in which the two kayakers had been positioned.</p>

             I was paddling with Eleanor on the Crooked. I don't really know what to write here; there really are no words which seem appropriate.

      Eleanor swam from her boat unexpectedly and was washed into a sieve where she became trapped. She was not visible from the water and was only spotted the following day by rescue helicopter. I searched for her on the river until it became dark, and then walked out to call the search and rescue. Samuel, the other member of our group also searched until dark, by which point he was unable to walk out. I returned with the search and rescue team to find him cold but physically fine.

      I'm not sure exactly what information has disseminated through to the UK, but I understand there have been some inaccuracies in the news reports.

      The river was at a good runnable level and I have no doubt that it was within the group's capablility.

      I cannot begin to imagine how hard this must be for Eleanor's family and close friends. I had only known Eleanor for a few days. She seemed to me as a number of people have already written: I was amazed at her confidence and ability, but more importantly she was one of the most instantly likeable people I've met. I know there are a lot of people who will miss Eleanor very much, and I think that is testament to the person she was.

      I met Eleanor's family when they flew out to New Zealand. I understand that close friends may want to talk to me about what happened, and am more than willing to help if I can.

      All I have left to say at the moment is how grateful I am to the rescue team and the West Coast paddling community for their help, kindness and support.

      And I know that everyone who knew Eleanor will remember her with a smile.

            <p>The kayakers had adequate experience and equipment for the trip, and had paddled other New Zealand rivers of similar difficulty.</p>

            <p>The river was at a good, runnable level and weather conditions were mild.</p>

            <p>The decision to wet-exit near the start of a difficult rapid increased the risk significantly (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.16">Recommendation 1.16</a>).</p>

            <p>The victim appeared passive in the water, and a more vigorous whitewater swimming technique may have carried the victim away from the slot (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.16">Recommendation 1.16</a>).</p>

            <p>None of the victim's kayaking clothers were brightly coloured. This may have been a contributing factor to the failure of the victim's companions to locate her.</p>

            <p>The onset of darkness around the time of the incident hampered rescue (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.9">Recommendation 1.9</a>).</p>

            <p>Protection of the rapid using a strategically-placed paddler and throwbag could have reduced the risk (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation2.11.5">Recommendation 2.11.5</a>).</p>

            <!-- The body of a 19-year-old female British kayaker has been recovered from a gorge in the Crooked River, 35km south east of Greymouth.
      The tourist was swept away last night while kayaking on the river, which feeds into Lake Brunner.
      A fellow kayaker, a male, walked for two hours out of the bush to raise the alarm at a Rotomanu farmhouse shortly after 9pm yesterday.
      A third man, believed to be from Sweden, was found by rescuers suffering from mild hypothermia at 2.45am today.
      St John ambulance West Coast district manager Brian Fancourt, said the victim fell out her kayak, was trapped by a rock and drowned.
      The body was recovered by the Solid Energy Rescue Helicopter around 10am.
      Mr Fancourt said the woman appeared to be wearing appropriate equipment, but the river was higher than usual.
      The helicopter was assisted by jet boats and local guides this morning.
      Rescue helicopter spokesman Brent Wilson said he was unable to fly last night when the search first began. He first took to the air at 6.30am today.
      "It was one of those black nights, there wasn't enough light.
      "It wouldn't have done any good anyway - the gorge is pretty tight."  -->

            <p>Victim paddled upstream from put-in into a 'birdsnest' eddy which collects debri from powerful currents. The victim capsized and did not attempt to roll and his kayak appeared to be empty. His companions searched from the river and banks and after several minutes the victim appeared around 30m downstream. Two paddlers recovered the victim and formed a raft with their kayaks (a Perception Pirouette S and a QK Bandit) and managed to administer CPR for 10-12 breaths. However, the raft disintegrated in the next rapids with one paddler swimming to shore. The other kayaker chased the victim through further rapids and he was eventually brought to sure 700m below the Roaring Meg powerstation. CPR was continued by fellow paddlers and passing motorists. Emergency services arrived quickly but resuscitation was unsuccessful.</p>

        <summary>
            <p>A party of four experienced paddlers put onto the Oparara river. Three of us attended an advanced white water safety course together last year. We all had safety equipment and creek boats. We started on the river at around 10am with plenty of food.</p>

            <p>We had heard that the top half of the river was &quot;stressfull&quot; thanks to the limestone features etc. and had noted that the guidebook specifically mentioned log-jams and rock-jams in this section which posed danger to kayakers. Nevertheless after a relaxing float down through some beautiful scenery we had an epic on the very first drop.</p>

            <p>We came to a tight chute with a small drop between a cliff and a large rock. We ummed and aahhed a bit at the top of the drop. We could see a pool below and everything looked nice and peaceful down below. There was a horizon line but we could see the bottom. After a bit of boat scouting the first person ran the drop. It looked  a bit ugly with lots of boat, paddle and person hitting rock but he stayed upright and was soon looking up at the others from the bottom of the drop. He sort of vaguely indicated an undercut. After a slight delay, the second paddler had a similar run down, tight and bumpy but made the pool at the bottom.</p>

            <p>The third paddler dropped down over the horizon line and promptly disappeared completely into a slot beneath the big rock.  After a very unpleasant ten seconds for all of the team the paddler climbed up out of the water through the same slot he had gone in. The boat was out of sight for at least 15 minutes and once we had caught a glimpse of it we still took 45 minutes and some fancy rope work to extract it. We tried a &quot;strong swimmer&quot; sort-of-thing with someone trying to get up and reach into the slot while attached to a rope; they couldn't get up and couldn't see it. About five minutes of observation was required to see a &quot;flash of red&quot;.</p>

            <p>Eventually we used an overhanging feature (a big old tree on top of a log) to lower someone in a harness (made from climbing tape) down the side of the rock, dangle them above the flow of water and let them use their arms and feet to manoeuver the boat end out of the slot. We then connected to the loops of the boat with a carabiner on another sling, attached the sling to a throw rope, lifted our hero out of the rapid and then pulled the boat out. The situation was very nasty and very dangerous. Fortunately everyone was OK and we got all of the equipment back too. We had a great day on the rest of the river.</p>

            <p>Don't be overconfident on &quot;easy rapids&quot; just because you are expecting more and feel like you are prepared.<br/>
                &quot;Switch-on&quot; as soon as you are on the river, not when you think the boating gets hard.<br/>
                Make sure you can see all the way down a drop/rapid not just the top and the bottom (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.19">Recommendation 1.19</a>).<br/>
                If you see something nasty at the bottom of a drop and your friends are at the top, tell them about it immediately and don't be afraid to advise them to scout or to walk. Just because one person got down doesn't mean everyone else will.<br/>
                Carrying safety kit and knowing how to use it can save you big dollars when it helps you extract your boat (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.9">Recommendation 1.9</a>).</p>

        <summary>
            <p>A party of six paddled the Mangakahia River from the road bridge north of Waimatenui. After 800m the victim advised several of the party to abandon the trip due to one having an unsuitable canoe and the other due to possible insufficient stamina for the strenuous trip ahead. The remaining four paddlers continued, inspecting all rapids from the bank.</p>

            <p>On reaching the junction of the Waiokumara Stream, one paddler canoed the junction rapid and the rapid following (which was out-of-sight to those upstream of the junction). After a few minutes he was followed by the victim, who hit a submerged rock mid-stream in the second rapid and his kayak immediately folded around it trapping him by the legs.</p>

            <p>The first paddler, who was inspecting the third rapid out-of-sight downstream, noticed a paddle and walked upstream to check. He found the victim just escaping from his kayak after tearing it apart with his bare hands and, after his swim down the remainder of the rapid, helped him ashore. The victim suffered from cuts to the backs of the knees and hands with bits of glass and resin embedded.</p>

            <p>The victim was not visible to the first paddler, or those who had yet to run the junction rapid, and was required to self-rescue. Watch all paddlers through all rapids (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation2.8">Recommendation 2.8</a>).</p>
            <p>For more difficult rapids, mitigate risks by placing paddlers in kayaks in eddies and people with throwbags on banks (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation2.11.5">Recommendation 2.11.5</a>).</p>

            <p>A party of seven put-on at Roaring Meg junction with the river dirty and rising. Shortly into the trip a paddler capsized, but held onto his canoe. He separated from the canoe and washed through three rapids. He was unconscious when another paddler reached him below the third rapid. The rescuer tried to lift him across the cockpit and tie his 'lifeline' around him, but in the face of an oncoming, turbulent rapid was forced to let the swimmer go.</p>

            <p>The rescuer waited at the bottom of the rapid but did not see the swimmer again. Three capsized canoes came down. After a further wait, the rescuer climbed out to the road and met up with the rest of the group. They alerted the police at Otaki, and a search was set in motion. The body was found the next morning, around 5km below the last sighting.</p>

        <summary>
            <p>Around 12:30pm, a tourist borrowed an 8-foot fibreglass canoe, intending to paddle Lake Tekapo to Motuariki Island. Conditions at departure were fine and calm. The paddler was alone, lightly-clad (in jeans, flannel shirt, jandals and a plastic parka) and without a lifejacket. From 1:15pm the wind came up, with gusts of 28kmh to 4pm, 37kmh after 4pm and 56kmh at 7pm. The lake became rough.</p>

            <p>A search was commenced that night, and again the next morning. The kayak was recovered from the western shore, along with socks, jandals and a paddle. Despite additional searching, no body was ever recovered.</p>

            <p>Lake Tekapo is up to 130m deep and filled with cold, glacial water at approximately 7C. The victim had discussed paddling the kayak with another tourist in the Youth Hostel and admitted to having never paddled before.</p>

He was wearing a green jersey and black trousers, and no life-jacket. He paddled to the far shore, then headed south. There was no wind till 10:30am, but the wind steadily increased to 18kmh between 11am and 12pm, with a gust of 36kmh at 11:40am.</p>

            <p>His vehicle was noticed on early on 7 July at Lake Horowhenua Domain, and a police search commenced on Monday 8 July. The kayak was found partly-full of water at the north-west end of lake. Separately, the paddle was found on 7 July. The body was found on the lake on 21 July. The retailer of the kayak said spray-skirt had not been purchased with the kayak but was on order.</p>

            <p>Two kayakers on flooded river, became trapped in a weir after failing to punch through the reversal. The force of the recirculation forced them under regularly over a 10 minute period, and stripped them of boots and a helmet. Their cries for help attracted rescuers, one of whom threw a 100m black extension cord, but the kayakers were unable to locate it in the turbulence. A climbing rope was procured and the kayakers were hauled out. Only one kayak was recovered.</p>

            <p>Local practice is to normally exit at the St David Street bridge and portage the weir (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.1">Recommendation 1.1</a>).</p>
            <p>High flow tends to increase the power of hydraulics, particularly weirs (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.25">Recommendation 1.25</a>).</p>
            <p>Artificial weirs are notorious for creating even hydraulics that are difficult, or even impossible, to escape from (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.23">Recommendation 1.23</a>).</p>
            <p>The kayakers were fortunate that they were in a populated area and rescuers were able to react quickly to locate useful equipment.</p>

            <p>A party of eight, including close relatives of the victim, descended the Manawatu Gorge from Ballance. Near the Ashhurst bridge, the nose of the victim's kayak became trapped in logs (willows?) and the swift-flowing water bent and pinned the kayak. Emergency services were alerted as companions and bystanders attempted to free the kayaker from the kayak. Ambulance staff, volunteer fire-fighters and bystanders all worked to keep the victim's head above water and to free the kayak.</p>

            <p>A paramedic managed to get a rope around the victim, but an attempt to lift the kayaker by helicopter was unsuccessful. When the rope was passed to police on the opposite bank, they were able to dislodge the victim and drag him across the river, still in the canoe. Attempts at resucitation were unsuccessful.</p>

            <p>The report that a pull from the opposite bank freed both victim and kayak suggests that a successful rescue may have been achieved if that option had been attempted early on.</p>

            <p>Having previously postponed a descent of the falls due to low water, a pair of kayakers took advantage of heavy rain to provide deep water at the base of 24m Waihi Falls. With two companions standing by with ropes, one paddler successfully ran the falls.</p>

            <p>At the lip of the falls, water pressure momentarily stuck the second kayaker's paddle against a rock. The kayaker was turned sideways as they dropped over the falls, falling backwards and without forward momentum. The paddler suffered two broken vertebrae and other leg and back injuries after hitting rocks behind the curtain of water. The kayaker managed to paddle to the river bank with the assistance of their companion, further assisted by throwbags from the shore. Only onshore was the extent of the injury revealed.</p>

            <p>The victim was subsequently evacuated by rescue helicopter to Palmerston North Hospital where the paddler's spine was screwed and plated. Recovery was undertaken at Burwood Spinal Unit in Christchurch.</p>

            <p>The kayakers were experienced, and took reasonable preparations and precautions for the descent.</p>
            <p>There are inherent risks in kayaking, and the risks are amplified in the case of waterfalls where significant impact forces can be generated.</p>

            <p>A kayaker on the Waikato river near the bridge below Lake Taupo became caught in the backwash below the bridge and washed up into one of the control gates. He climbed onto a ledge for safety while the kayak was tumbled in the turbulent water. A passer-by alerted police and two-and-a-half hours later the paddler was hauled to safety on the bridge by firefighters and police working with a rescue harness and rope. Light was provided by the Lion Foundation Rescue Helicopter spotlight. Local kayakers stood by with throw bags. Rescue IRB stood by down stream.

They refused to proceed and waited on a sandbank near Walls Whare while the other paddlers continued to a farmhouse and raised the alarm. Darkness fell and after  four-and-a-half hours the pair were located and evacuated by the Westpac rescue helicopter and treated at Masterton hospital for hypothermia.

        <summary>
            <p>A group of five paddlers were close to finishing the challenging Nevis River, when one paddler capsized on the last hard rapid (cascade rapid on a left-hand bend). As he leaned forward to protect his face and roll, the paddler was 'pile-driven' into a rock, hitting his head with considerable force and snapping his paddle shaft. The kayaker rolled up and became stuck in a small hole in the bottom of the rapid and capsized again. Unable to get out of the hole with half a paddle, the paddler swam to shore with all equipment.</p>

            <p>The kayaker had a large gash to top of head which was bleeding copiously and complained of a sore back. The wound was succesfully bandaged. A split paddle enabled the trip to continue. The paddler suffered considerable back pain, but it was more painful to portage than paddle. Soon after, the kayaker's boat split and was unpaddleable. Two team members paddled out to get a helicopter, two others stayed with the victim. He changed into warm, dry clothes and waited approx. two hours for the helicopter to arrive. The victim was transported to Frankton hospital for stitches. X-rays identified two vertebrae with compression fractures.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>This was an experienced team of kayakers paddling a difficult river. The team was well prepared for this incident, carrying split paddles, spare dry clothing, food, throwbags, rescue equipment and a cellphone. They had plenty of daylight allowing two paddlers to stay with victim until the  helicopter arrived and still be able to paddle out. It was interesting that, despite a 10cm gash to the head, the victim's helmet was not marked (perhaps a flat rock surface?). Despite this the helmet was retired and put in pride of place on the mantlepiece as a life-saver!</p>

            <p>A party of two kayakers on sit-on-top kayaks set out on placid water. The paddlers went over Okoroire Falls into a gorge and were thrown from their kayaks. At the falls the entire river enters a rock sieve. One made it to shore suffering cuts, bruises and hypothermia. The other paddler was missing and searches were unsuccessful. The body was located 18 days after the accident.</p>
        </summary>
        <discussion>
            <p>The party have been described as experienced. They wore lifejackets and the kayaks were probably appropriate for the initial section of water (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.5">Recommendation 1.5</a>).</p>
            <p>It appears that the kayakers were surprised by the gorge and falls. Kayakers should find out as much as practicable about the river trip (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.1">Recommendation 1.1</a>).</p>
            <p>Even familiar stretches may contain a new hazard (due to treefall or slips, for example). Always scout what you can't see from the water (<a href="/article/code-of-practice#recommendation1.19">Recommendation 1.19</a>).</p>
            <p>A sign warning of the falls' extreme danger was found downstream. Police suspect vandalism.</p>

            <p>A group of friends put into the Opihi River at Hanging Rock and paddled down the river. At a point where the river narrows and the water speed increases, a paddler spotted a steel stake in the river. He attempted to paddle away from the stake but capsized and was washed against the stake with the stake lying across the cockpit, preventing him from exiting his boat.  His head was above water.</p>
            <p>His companion(s) contacted two local fishermen who came to assist.  One of the fishermen donned a bouyancy aid and waded out to the trapped victim.  He was able to wriggle the boat free from the stake. The victim swam to shore unassisted.  His boat, but not his paddle, was recovered.</p>

            <p>A group of five paddlers inspected Rooster Tail, on their second run through the gorge. One paddler, aiming river right to punch through the right buffer wave, instead got curled into it and subbed out. The kayaker was kicked left and upside down into Pig's Trough.</p>

            <p>The kayaker was violently pushed onto rocks on the riverbed, sustaining several vertical shocks on their helmet. The kayaker flushed, rolled up and caught an eddy. In the eddy they noticed a stiff and painful neck, a chipped tooth and lacerations.</p>

            <p>The paddler transferred to a creek boat, was assisted in ferrying to river right, and helped out of the gorge. They walked to below the whitewater, and then rafted-up with two boaters to the takeout. X-rays and CTs at Christchurch Hospital diagnosed a fracture of the C2 vertebra.</p>

            <!--      We paddled up from the take out and then walked up to the get in just above Rooster Tail. During the second run, going 3rd, I boofed as  normal over the central Rooster Tale rock tongue, landed on the top of the hydraulic and aimed river right, intending to punch through the right  buffer wave and got curled into it and subbed only to reappear by another minor hole in the river center with a left oriented kick out, upside down.

            This minor hole translated me further river left and made it to fast and to hard for me to manage to roll. I went over Pig's trough upside down, got sucked with a lot of velocity on the river bottom rocks, and sustained two major uniaxial vertical shocks on my head. i got flushed easily, rolled up and caught and eddy, realising that my neck was extremely stiff and  painful, and feeling blood running along my face. A chip of one of my tooth was missing too. Realising this, my mates transferred me into a creeker with as much care as could be provided, then provided an assisted ferry to the river right and helped me out and uo the gorge letting me walk with one of them carrying my gear down through to the bottom of the white water section, where we put in again and from where I got rafted by two boaters to the take out. We ten jumped in the car and drove to Chch and then to the hospital where a c2 vertebra fracture was diagnose later in the night after multiple xrays and ct imaging.

            <p>Shallow holes with violent hydraulics are a recognised hazard, and are usually avoided. Kayakers occasionally drop into them as a consequence of a missed line.</p>

            <p>The group's response was appropriate and prudent, and managed to avoid more serious consequences.</p>

            <p>If a neck injury is suspected, it may be more appropriate to completely immobilise the patient and seek helicopter or stretcher evacuation.</p>

            <p>Around midday a party of four kayakers set off down Awesome Gorge in high flow (gates open). In the narrow gorge (approx. 3m wide) they encountered several logs forming an X and one kayaker became between the trees under water. One of the group hiked out of the gorge and across farmland to raise the alarm. The body and kayak were recovered late that afternoon</p>

            <p>Group of four experienced kayakers put in at roadside and kayaked all rapids down to flat section where river flows through a culvert (becomes a ford at paddled flows). The river did not flow completely over the culvert with places where it only went under. Two kayakers approached center river, the other two attempted to cross over river right. The two to the right collided with each other and broached leaning downstream against the culvert. One kayaker lost his paddle and was sucked under culvert. The second kayaker is also sucked under and forced to swim before going under culvert, followed by her boat. First kayaker is flushed out downstream and swims out of boat conscious. Second kayaker and boat flush out downstream.</p>
            <p>The other two kayakers had started to out before the victims went under and by the time they were out of their boats the victims had flushed out. All gear and people recovered.</p>
